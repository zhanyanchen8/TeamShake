Throughout my academic career, I have seen teachers struggle to 
create working teams. Previously, teachers would use time-consuming methods like telling
students to count off, forming their own groups, or randomly drawing sticks out of
a cup. In addition, the groups that are formed from these efforts are often
unproductive and students do not often come out with improvements in their abilities
to work with others in a team. Therefore, I created this program to mitigate these
issues so the best teams can be chosen quickly.

Future changes to the project include forming a .jar file, using machine learning algorithm to create teams
and making the user interface easier to use for teachers when adding students into the system.

Begin operating program by running MainActivity.
